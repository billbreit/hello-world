### hello-world Test Site 

This is a learning project for GitHub.  

My ultimate goal is to:
* Develop foundation libraries for "bit logic applications".
* develop and publish common tools for Python, MicroPython and if possible Circuit Python, as well as other noteworthy Python variants.

In the meantime, I've added a working version of bitlogic.py, for debugging binary logic apps and as a compendium of bit logic idioms.
