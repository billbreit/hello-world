### hello-world Test Site 

This is a learning project for GitHub.  

The ultimate goal is to develop and publish common tools for Python, MicroPython and if possible Circuit Python, as well as other noteworthy Python variants.

I was thinking about OnePython or PyWorld or something like that for the name of the permanent project ... I have alot to do.
